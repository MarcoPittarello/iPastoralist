\title{First ten species for dendrogram}
\usage{
first_ten_species(data_SRA_SC, join.dendrogram, cluster.hclust)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_SRA_SC}{database with abundance data expressed as SRA or SC, calculated with \link[iPastoralist]{vegetation_abundance}.Database class must be \emph{data.frame}. Rows are species and Columns are surveys. Species names must be included as row names and not in the data.}

\item{join.dendrogram}{LOGICAL. TRUE if species abundance need to be joined with a dendrogram.}

\item{cluster.hclust}{output from 'hclust' function of 'stats' package}
}
\value{
when 'join.dendrogram' = TRUE: a dataframe in which surveys are orderd in the same way of the dendrogram and for each of them are listed the species orderd dicreasingly by their abundance.
when 'join.dendrogram' = FALSE: a dataframe in which for each survey the species are ordered decreasingly by their abundance
