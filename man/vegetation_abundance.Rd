\title{Transform Frequency of occurrence (FO) to Species relative abundance (SRA) or Species percentage cover(\%SC)}
\usage{
vegetation_abundance(database, method, species.cover.coefficient)
}
\arguments{
\item{database}{database with FO and occasional species as 999. Rows are species and columns are surveys. The first column of the database reports the species names. Database class must be \emph{data.frame}}

\item{method}{\itemize{
\item \strong{"SRA_fo"}: SRA calculated from FO without occasional species.see \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoPittarello/iPastoralist/main/man/figures/Wrkflw_abundance_conversion.png}{MarcoPittarello/iPastoralist} for a full graphical explanation
\item \strong{"SC_fo"}: \%SC calculated by multiplying FO for a coeffient so that the number of total measurements along the transect line refer to 100 (occasional species are excluded). see \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoPittarello/iPastoralist/main/man/figures/Wrkflw_abundance_conversion.png}{MarcoPittarello/iPastoralist} for a full graphical explanation
\item \strong{"SC_fo_occ"}: like SC_fo but with in addition the occasional species, considered as 0.3\%. The total \%SC  per each surveys will be > 100 \%. see \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoPittarello/iPastoralist/main/man/figures/Wrkflw_abundance_conversion.png}{MarcoPittarello/iPastoralist} for a full graphical explanation
\item \strong{"SRA_SC.fo.occ"}: SRA calculated from SC_fo_occ, i.e. rescale SC_fo_occ so that the total sum per each survey sum up to 100 \%. see \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoPittarello/iPastoralist/main/man/figures/Wrkflw_abundance_conversion.png}{MarcoPittarello/iPastoralist} for a full graphical explanation

\item{species.cover.coefficient}{Coeffient that multiplies FO so that the number of total touches refer to 100. Only required when method = "SC_fo_occ","SC_fo", "SRA_SC.fo.occ"}

\description{
From a database with Frequency of occurrences of species identified along a linear transect and occasional species (i.e. species found within vegetation plots but not along the linear transects), Species relative abundance (SRA) and percentage species cover(\%SC) are computed, either considering or not considering occasional species.\cr

Terminology:
\itemize{
\item Frequency of occurrence \strong{(FO)} : number of species occurrences out of 'N' points of vegetation measurements along a transect line
\item Species relative abundance \strong{(SRA)} : ratio between frequency of occurrence and the sum of frequency of occurrences values for all species in the transect, then multiplied by 100
\item Species percentage cover \strong{(\%SC)}: conversion of frequency of occurrence to 100 measurements (e.g. if a species had a FO= 20 measurements out of 50 total measurements along the transect line, the FO will be multiplied by 2). To all occasional species (i.e. species found within vegetation plots but not along the linear transects) a \%SC value = 0.3\% is attributed.\cr

\examples{
 Structure of the database to use as input:

      Rows: species
      Columns: vegetation survey
      Headings and row names must be imported

       	  Species   ril1     ril2
            spe1      12
            spe2              5
            spe3      2      999
            spe4      10
            spe5             20

          Note 1: For species without FO leave the cells empty (NA values)
          Note 2: occasional species (i.e. "+") as 999\cr
